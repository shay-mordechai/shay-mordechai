# Hi there, I'm Shay! 👋

### 🛡️ Security Researcher | Vulnerability Discovery & Network Internals

I specialize in **Vulnerability Research**, **Network Security**, and **Data-Driven Threat Detection**.
My work bridges the gap between **Low-Level Internals** (Binary Analysis, Raw Sockets) and **Secure Architecture** (Zero Trust, AI Agents). I leverage automation and AI-augmented workflows to deconstruct complex systems and identify malicious patterns within noise.

### 🔭 Featured Research & Projects

**🐛 AI-Augmented Vulnerability Research (SBCL Compiler)**
* **Zero-Day Discovery:** Orchestrated an AI-driven fuzzing workflow identifying **3 Zero-Day vulnerabilities** (Memory Corruption, Buffer Overflow, Stack Exhaustion) in the SBCL compiler.
* **Technical Analysis:** Performed binary analysis on symbol flag modification processes and memory boundary violations.
* **Impact:** Verified 100% success rate for DoS attack vectors; findings reported to **Israel National CERT**.

**🔐 LeadFlowAI (Secure-by-Design SaaS)**
* **Zero Trust Architecture:** Engineered a "Dark Server" environment on AWS with **zero public inbound ports**, utilizing **Cloudflare Argo tunnels** for secure ingress.
* **Hardening:** Implemented rootless **Podman** containers on Fedora Linux to mitigate container breakout vulnerabilities.
* **AI Agent:** Built a multimodal AI agent (Gemini 1.5 Flash) capable of parsing voice and text for complex CRM reasoning.
* [🚀 Live Demo](https://my-leads.app/)

**🦁 Predator: Hybrid-Core Trading Engine ("Project Sniper")**
* **Intelligence Stack:** Fused **XGBoost** predictive models with a **Gemini Pro** decision engine to analyze market sentiment and automate risk-based liquidation.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Developed a heuristic engine to identify behavioral anomalies (e.g., "Whale" accumulation) and filter volatility regimes in real-time.
* **Fail-Safe Logic:** Engineered a robust logic layer ensuring autonomous risk management during API instability.

**📡 Network Protocol & Traffic Analysis Toolset**
* **TLS Traffic Generator:** Built a custom traffic generator using **Scapy** and implemented core protocols (HTTP/DNS/SMTP) from scratch using **Raw Sockets** for deep packet inspection.
* **Adversarial Simulation:** Researching encryption protocols and traffic manipulation techniques to simulate complex network attack vectors.
* **Architectural Hardening:** Proposed a deterministic TTL-based mitigation for DNS Rebinding (LANJack) vulnerability, validated through research and collaboration with industry network vendors.
