# Hi there, I'm Shay! 👋

### 🛡️ Security Researcher | Network Protocols & Anomaly Detection

I specialize in **Network Security** and **Data-Driven Threat Detection**.
My research bridges the gap between **Low-Level Internals** (Packet Analysis, Raw Sockets) and **High-Volume Data Engineering** (ETL, Behavioral Anomaly Detection). I leverage automation and algorithmic logic to deconstruct complex systems and identify malicious patterns within noise.

### 🔭 Current Projects & Research

**🎯 Real-Time Anomaly Detection System ("Project Sniper"):**
* Architected a high-performance **ETL Pipeline** (Python/SQL) ingesting real-time financial time-series data.
* Developed a **Heuristic Detection Engine** to identify behavioral anomalies (e.g., "Whale" accumulation, Iceberg orders) and separate signal from noise.
* Applying **Threat Hunting methodologies** to financial markets, simulating SIEM/XDR logic to detect manipulation patterns.

**📡 Network Protocol & Traffic Analysis Toolset:**
* **TLS Traffic Generator:** Built a custom traffic generator using **Scapy** and implemented core protocols (HTTP/DNS/SMTP) from scratch using **Raw Sockets** for deep packet inspection.
* **Adversarial Simulation:** Researching encryption protocols and traffic manipulation techniques to simulate complex network attack vectors.

**🏴‍☠️ Operation Blackbird (CTF Platform):**
* Developed a custom **MITM Simulation Platform** (3,400+ LoC) focusing on Certificate Authority (CA) attacks.
* Designed scenarios for intercepting and forging Certificate Signing Requests (CSR) using **Burp Suite**.
