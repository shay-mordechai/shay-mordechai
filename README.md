# Hi there, I'm Shay! 👋

### 🛡️ Security Researcher | Cloud-Native Security & DevSecOps Specialist

I specialize in **Runtime Threat Detection** and **Vulnerability Research**, focusing on the intersection of Linux Internals and Cloud Infrastructure. I build tools to turn raw system events into actionable security insights.

### 🔭 Areas of Focus & Research

**Cloud-Native Security Research (Kubernetes):**
* Architecting nested virtualization environments to explore attack surfaces (Fedora/Kubeadm).
* Researching **Lateral Movement** vectors and **Container Escapes** using CNI (Calico) and runtime tools like **Falco**.
* *Lab currently focused on threat-modeling and policy-bypass simulations.*


**Vulnerability Research (SBCL Compiler):**
* Orchestrated a research workflow identifying 3 potential vulnerabilities (Memory Corruption/Logical flaws).
* Leveraging **Fuzzing** and **Crash Analysis** to understand memory layout and input validation.
* 🔒 *Project is currently private under Responsible Disclosure.*

**[Network-Security-Toolbox](https://github.com/tshay0129/Network-Security-Toolbox):** * Developing custom security tools in Python (Scapy) for protocol analysis.
* Implementing core protocols (HTTP, DNS, SMTP) from scratch using **Raw Sockets**.
