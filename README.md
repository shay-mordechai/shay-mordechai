# Hi there, I'm Shay! 👋

### 🛡️ Security Researcher | Cloud-Native Security & Detection Engineering

I specialize in **Runtime Threat Detection** and **Vulnerability Research**, bridging the gap between low-level system internals and scalable cloud infrastructure. My focus is on turning raw system events into actionable security insights using SQL and behavioral analysis.

### 🔭 Current Research & Projects

* **[K8s-Runtime-Security-Lab](https://github.com/tshay0129/K8s-Runtime-Security-Lab):** * Building a **Security Data Lake** for Kubernetes. 
    * Developing custom **Falco** rules to detect Container Escapes and privilege escalation.
    * Performing **Threat Hunting with SQL** (AWS Athena/SQLite) to correlate kernel events with attack patterns.

* **SBCL Compiler Research (Zero-Day):** * Discovered a **Lexical Isolation Bypass** and Logical flaws in the SBCL compiler (Common Lisp). 
    * Utilized **Semantic Fuzzing** and **Binary Analysis (IDA Pro)** to identify memory-unsafe behaviors. 
    * *Currently under Responsible Disclosure.*

* **[Operation BLACKBIRD](https://github.com/tshay0129/Network-Security-Toolbox):** * Simulating C2 communication and data exfiltration over covert channels (ICMP).
