# Hi there, I'm Shay! 👋

### 🛡️ Security Researcher | AI-Augmented Vulnerability Research | Cloud-Native

I specialize in **Runtime Threat Detection** and **Vulnerability Research**, focusing on the intersection of Low-Level mechanisms and Cloud Infrastructure. 
I leverage **AI-driven methodologies** (Agents & LLMs) to accelerate the deconstruction of complex systems—from the Linux Kernel to Browser Internals.

### 🔭 Current Research & Areas of Focus

**🚀 AI-Augmented Vulnerability Research (SBCL Compiler):**
* Orchestrated a high-efficiency research workflow using **AI Agents** to identify **3 potential vulnerabilities** (Memory Corruption/Logical flaws).
* Leveraging automated crash analysis and AI-assisted Fuzzing to map compiler memory layouts.
* 🔒 *Project is currently private under Responsible Disclosure.*

**🌐 JIT & Browser Security (V8 Engine):**
* Researching V8 engine optimizations (Ignition/TurboFan) and their implications on memory safety.
* Developing automated research labs using **Google Antigravity** to simulate RWX memory exploitation and JIT-spray patterns.
* *Latest Analysis:* [Deep Dive into JIT & Isolation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shay-mor/recent-activity/all/)

**☁️ Cloud-Native Security (Kubernetes):**
* Architecting nested virtualization environments to explore **Lateral Movement** and **Container Escapes** (Fedora/Kubeadm).
* Researching Runtime Security using eBPF (Falco) and CNI bypasses (Calico).
* Focused on threat-modeling for immutable systems (Fedora Kinoite).
