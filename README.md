# Hi there, I'm Shay! 👋

### 🛡️ Junior Security Researcher | Networks & Cloud

I specialize in bridging the gap between **Low-Level Security** and **Cloud Infrastructure**. I have a deep passion for understanding how data flows, from individual packets to complex cloud architectures.

- **Cloud Posture Research:** Documenting attack vectors in AWS/GCP, focusing on **IAM**, **IMDS**, and Cloud Misconfigurations.
- **Operation BLACKBIRD:** A custom CTF platform simulating C2 communication and data exfiltration over ICMP.
- **Linux Hardening:** Exploring immutable operating systems (Fedora Kinoite) and container security.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Scapy, Socket), Bash, C++, x86/ARM Assembly.
